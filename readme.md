<h1>About this App:</h1>
<p>
This app opens the webcam of a user's computer and monitors the frames using pixel color
differentiation. It is required that the first frame be an empty static frame of the camera's
background. Once a new object enters the field of view it will be outlined in a green box.
When that object exits the frame an email will be sent to the email specified account. User 
must enter a sender, receiver, and password to the empty variables at the top of "emailing.py.
